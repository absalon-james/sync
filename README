This repo is a collection of salt states meant to syncronize one or more
directories across multiple servers. This is accomplished by using lsyncd,
csync2, and xinetd.

These states are very, very version specific.
Only tested so far on Ubuntu 12.04, Lsyncd 2.0.4. The lua for the lsyncd
configuration will need to change if using other versions of lsyncd.
